# IOT-DEVICES
Zigbee-enabled sensors collect data like temperature,humidity and send it to the cloud via HTTP protocol. It is an IoT-based system that collects the data in real-time and stores it in an SQL database. We generate Web applications through which we can analyze the data, remote monitoring and decision-making operations.
